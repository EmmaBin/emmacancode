                My first job was a three-year stint as a flight attendant with Singapore Airlines.
                This experience allowed me to travel to over 20 countries and instilled in me a keen attention to detail,
                as well as a customer-first mindset.

                I moved to the U.S. to pursue higher education and was inspired to become a teacher by my mother,
                who herself was an educator.
                During my three-year tenure as an elementary school teacher,
                I became a well-rounded individual.
                I was proactive in adapting my lesson plans according to teaching outcomes
                and was committed to differentiation to meet diverse learning needs.
                I also successfully built a strong rapport with my students and their parents,
                which further enriched my teaching experience.

                When it comes to coding, I can hardly believe I'm doing it.
                I grew up in China, where the social vibe was that girls weren't good at math.
                So, I picked liberal arts in high school, staying clear of anything math-heavy.
                Fast forward to today, and I'm thrilled that I had the guts to switch careers and dive into coding from scratch.
                This new chapter has been an eye-opener, teaching me more about myself than I ever knew.
                Plus, I've got to say, I'm loving the coding community.
                It's not just about solving real-world problems;
                it's a place where people without many privileges get a chance to shine, too.

                In my free time, I unwind by taking calligraphy classesâ€”it's like meditation for me.
                I'm also a fan of cooking up new recipes, diving into mystery novels,
                especially the ones that remind me of Agatha Christie,
                and catching a good movie now and then.
